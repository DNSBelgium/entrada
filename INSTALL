# Upgrading to version 0.0.5

A new column (server_location) has been added in this version, this columns is used to store the anycast server location.
Any input directory using the format <servername>_<location> will be parsed into a server and location component.
The server component value will be used for the Parquet "server" partition, the location component value will be stored in the "server_location" column.

This allows for partition pruning at the logical server level while still being able to determine the anycast location for every packet.
